# A/B-Testing-without-sampling

Welcome to my A/B Testing project! This project focuses on conducting an A/B test to evaluate the impact of 2 different variations of a website a  conversion rates. The goal of this experiment was to test hypotheses and derive actionable insights that can improve decision-making.

## ğŸ“Š Objective
The primary objective of this A/B test was to:
- **Test**: different webpage layouts.
- **Measure Impact**: conversion rate.
- **Determine**: Whether one version (control or treatment) performs significantly better than the other in terms of the key metric.

## ğŸ§ª Results
- **Conclusion**: There is no significant difference between two groups when performed Mann-Whitney U Test as the data is not Normally distributed.

## ğŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data**: [From Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zhangluyuan/ab-testing/data)
- **Statistical Tests**: K-Stest, Anderson-Darling test to check normality; Mann-Whitney U Test.

## ğŸ“‚ Files in This Repository
- `A/B_testing_without_sampling-Web_page_conversion.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used for cleaning and preparing the dataset and conducting the A/B test.
